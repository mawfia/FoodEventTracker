# Food Event Tracker
Individual Project created 16 December 2016

INTRODUCTION:
--------------------
This is a Single Page Application Spring/REST CRUD project designed, built, and deployed to cloud services over a period of 2 days.

HOW TO USE:
---------------------
The below link will take you to the current list of food attached to the list.  A display of the total weight and price is on the top left.  The "home" button will display the full list of items.  The "new" button will generate a form allowing the use to input information for a new item to be attached to the list.  To the right of each item are buttons that allow the use to "update" or "delete" from the list.


TECHNOLOGY USED:
-----------------
1.  All back-end logic, front-end logic and data storage was executed using JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, JPA, and MySQL.

3.  Maven was used to manage the libraries for XML dependencies.

4.  Bootstrap was used for front-end design and operations such as regular expressions for exception prevention and dynamically populated fields and drop-down lists were implemented using HTML5 and CSS.

6.  Apache Tomcat is used as the server for execution and JavaScript handles server/client requests.

7.  Spring/REST is the framework used for dynamic management of objects with Spring Entity Manager.

8.  The application is deployed on a AWS account for cloud services.
